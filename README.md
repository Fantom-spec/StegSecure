StegSecure

A Python‑based steganography and secure messaging framework.
StegSecure lets you embed, extract, and communicate hidden messages securely, with optional cryptographic keys and Discord bot integration.

🚀 Features

🔐 Secure message handling using keys (optional auto‑generation)

📦 CLI commands for setup and configuration

🧠 Steganography utilities for hiding and retrieving data

🤖 Optional Discord integration support

🛠 Designed for research and experimentation

🧩 Getting Started
📋 Requirements

Make sure you have:

Python 3.8+

pip installed

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

⚙️ Environment Setup

Create a .env file at the root:

TRUST_KEY=<auto-generated or provided>
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your bot token>
CHANNEL_ID=<integer channel id>
NAME=<your name>


You can generate or set this automatically via the CLI.

🧰 CLI Commands

Use the CLI to configure your environment easily.

Initialize / Configure
python stegsecure.py init <name>


You’ll be prompted for:

Discord bot token (hidden input)

Discord channel ID (integer only)

A random trust key will be generated (optional)

This command saves values to .env.

Generate or Set TRUST_KEY Only
python stegsecure.py trust-key


This will auto‑generate and save a new secure trust key.

Or provide one manually:

python stegsecure.py trust-key --value YOUR_KEY_HERE

📄 Example Usage
Running initialization
python stegsecure.py init MyProject


Expected result:

Enter Discord bot token:
Enter Discord channel ID:
Configuration saved to .env

⚠️ Security Best Practices

Never commit .env — keep secrets local

Use strong, random tokens

Regenerate keys if leaked

For production bots, use Discord OAuth2 and bot permissions securely

🧪 Tests & Development

Add tests and scripts as needed for your workflows. You can use CI (GitHub Actions) or local test suites to validate functionality before pushing.

Steganography is the practice of hiding information inside other files so that the existence itself of the message is concealed. Tools and techniques range from LSB manipulation to encrypted payloads embedded in images, audio, or other media formats.
